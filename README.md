Scraper
Scraper.py creates a simple webscraper for information about local resturants in the seattle area.
The input into the file is a weburl and requested search paramaters. The output will be a file called
final_info.txt. The final report will be a list of each resturant along with its number of inspections,
highest inspection score and average score. The current file only looks at ZIP 98109.
